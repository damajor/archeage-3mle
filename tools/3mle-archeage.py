# Tool to convert songs made in 3MLE or imported
# into 3MLE from a MIDI file for use in Archeage.

# Volume conversion: 3mle = archeage
# v0 = v0
# v1 = v9
# v2= v18
# v3= v26
# v4= v35
# v5= v43
# v6= v51
# v7= v60
# v8= v68
# v9= v76
# v10=v85
# v11= v93
# v12= v101
# v13= v110
# v14= v118
# v15= v127

# What needs to be done
# Any "o" needs to be increased by one
# Any "v" needs to be adjusted as above
# Any "n" needs to be mapped back to a note with the appropriate octave change
# If there are any instances of "l" being used, a new track must default back
# to "l4" unless it starts with an "l" setting.
