		<h2>3MLE to Archeage converter</h2>
		<p>This utilty takes code exported from 3MLE and fixes it for use in Archeage</p>
		<p>Steps taken are:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Converts octaves to be correct unless nooctave is checked</li>
			<li>Converts velocity (volume) from Mabiogi levels to AAU levels unless novolume is checked</li>
			<li>Converts N notes created by 3MLE optimization to their correct note with octave offset</li>
			<li>Fixes note length at the start of new tracks if needed</li>
		</ul>
		<form action = "/cgi-bin/3mle-archeage.cgi" method = "POST" target = "_blank">
			<input type = "checkbox" name = nooctave value = "off" />
			<input type = "checkbox" name = novolume value = "off" />
			<textarea name = "mle" cols = "76" rows = "10"></textarea>
